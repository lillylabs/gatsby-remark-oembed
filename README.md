# Gatsby Remark Oembed Plugin

> This GatsbyJS Remark Sub-Plugin transforms oembed links (Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Vimeo, SoundCloud, CodePen etc.) into its corresponding embed code.

This is an early version of the plugin. Let me know if you have problems or questions by submitting an issue.

## Install

`npm install @raae/gatsby-remark-oembed`

## Requirements

- Node version 8 and up.
- Gatsby version >=2.0.88
- Gatsby Transformer Remark Plugin >=2.0.0

## Oembed support

Under the hood the oembed provider list from [oembed.com](https://oembed.com/) is used.

So far these providers are confirmed to be working: CodePen, Flickr, Instagram, Reddit, Twitch, Twitter, Vimeo, YouTube, SoundCloud.

Twitter, Flickr, Instagram and Reddit requires external javascript to be added to every page. So make sure to exclude the ones you do not need.

## Example site

Check out [gatsby-remark-oembed.netlify.com/](https://gatsby-remark-oembed.netlify.com/). Its source code can be found on [Github](https://github.com/raae/gatsby-remark-oembed-example-site).

## How to use

### Configuration

```js
// In your gatsby-config.js
plugins: [
  {
    resolve: `gatsby-transformer-remark`,
    options: {
      plugins: [
        {
          resolve: `@raae/gatsby-remark-oembed`,
          options: {
            usePrefix: true,
            providers: {
              // Important to exclude providers
              // that adds js to the page.
              // If you do not need them.
              exclude: ["Reddit"]
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
];
```

#### Optional `settings` for providers

Many oEmbed providers offer additional options for configure the display of the embed.

For example, for Instagram see [Instagram – Embedding for Developers](https://www.instagram.com/developer/embedding/), which describes the additional oEmbed parameters you might want to change for the embed.

```js
// …
{
  resolve: `@raae/gatsby-remark-oembed`,
  options: {
    usePrefix: true,
    providers: {
      include: [
        'Twitter',
        'Instagram',
      ]
      settings: {
        // Ex. Show all Twitter embeds with the dark theme
        Twitter: { theme: 'dark' },
        // Ex. Hide all Instagram comments by default
        Instagram: { hidecaption: true },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

### Content

```
// In your markdown file

Check it out! I can use oembed links in my markdown.
